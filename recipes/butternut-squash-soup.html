         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>Butternut Squash Soup makes an excellent meal on a cold or rainy day, as well as a great starter dish
            for a larger multi-course meal. The natural sweetness derived from the butternut squash pairs nicely with a 
            multitude of different breads and salads, making it an excellent choice. It's also quite simple to make!

         <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 jalepeño chile pepper, seeded and diced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 (2 lb) butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cubed</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 oz) can chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid oz) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste</li>
         </ul>
         <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, jalepeño, and ginger; cook and stir until onion has sotened and turned translucent, about 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add butternut squash and chicken broth; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until squash is tender, about 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Stir in evaporated milk, coconut milk, sugar, salt, and black pepper; cook and stir 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Fill a blender halfway with soup. Cover and hold lid down with a folded kitchen towel; pulse a few times before leaving on to purée. Pour into a clean pot. Repeat with remaining soupp. Or purée soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Garnish servings with sour cream and thyme.</li>
