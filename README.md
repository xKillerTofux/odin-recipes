Hello!
This is my beginning project. I hope by the end of the lessons I'm taking with TOP that I will have learned some basic skills to build a website.
This site is to serve as my portfolio both to show off skills I have acquired, and to practice and apply things I have learned.
I want to use these skills to then update my own websites that currently use site-building software. I also have a unique problem that needs solving that I believe web-based solutions can resolve. This is purposefully a bit vague until I learn more about what I'm doing, before I present that issue.
But there is a main goal!
Thanks in advance to any and all people able to help me with my coding education!
